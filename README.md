# Wordle-Game
Wordle is a simple word game that challenges people to find a five-letter word by guessing. Within this version of Wordle, a user will have 6 chances to guess a random 5 letter word. However, this game will try to guide the user towards the correct answer upon every incorrect answer. Anytime the user answers a word, some letters within the word get coloured. The letters that aren't coloured are not all within the word to be guessed. The words coloured in yellow, however, are in the word to be guessed, however, in the incorrect place. Lastly, any letter coloured in green is in the word the user is trying to guess and in the correct position. If the user does not guess the word within 6 guesses, the correct answer will be revealed.
